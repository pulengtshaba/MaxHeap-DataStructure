# Max heap data structure(Walmart)

## project lead is calling it a power of two max heap. The rest of your team is doing their best to come up with a better name. The requirements of the data structure are as follows:

* The heap must satisfy the heap property.
* Every parent node in the heap must have 2^x children.
* The value of x must be a parameter of the heapâ€™s constructor.
* The heap must implement an insert method.
* The heap must implement a pop max method.
* The heap must be implemented in Java.
* The heap must be performant.
* You must use a more descriptive variable name than x in your implementation.
